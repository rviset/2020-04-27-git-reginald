# 2020-04-27: Git Lesson

- init: create a git repository in current directory
    - you should only do this once in a repository (i.e., no nested git repos)
- status: tells you what is going on
- add: put files into the staging area
- commit: commit the stageing area with a message
    - `commit -m`: commit with the message with the message without opening up text editor
- `log`: look at all the commit history you've been doing
    - `log --oneline`: simple oneline log view
- `diff`: look at differences between current state and what git knows
- `checkout`: moving out head
    - `checkout <HASH> <file>` : restores file from the <hash>
    - `checkout <HASH>` : moves HEAD to that location
        `git checkout master` : go back to our original place
- `HEAD`: place we're looking at right now on our computer

- remote: a place where the git repo is stored, e.g., GitHub
    - `git remote add origin <URL>` add a remote
- `git push origin master : to push the master branch on our local computer to the remote named origin

- editing lines in different places is okay. You might get a merge conflict if you edit the same location.
